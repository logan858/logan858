  ## My name is Logan, and I enjoy problem solving
  ```This is where I would mention a fun fact about myself, or list all the technologies I've worked with. It makes sense, it's a great opportunity to use pretty icons on a github profile, we've all got a collection of them. I'm more than a technology stack though, and I'd wager that we'd both get a lot more value from having a conversation instead. Check my bookings calendar below```
